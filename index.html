            <p>Hello and welcome to my webpage! My name is Ashley Holanda and I am currently an accounts payable
              coordinator aspiring to be a web developer. My journey in web design began when I was in the 3rd grade,
              creating HTML web pages for my Neopets. I continued to learn the basics through customizing my social
              media pages and through rudimentary courses in high school and college. Now I am ready to delve into
              deeper depths by taking the Rutgers Coding Boot Camp.</p>
            <p>When it comes to the concept of "left brain" and "right brain", I have been told that I am equally both.
              My best subjects in school were math and science, however, my passions lie in the arts with hobbies like
              drawing and writing. My desire is to combine the logical and the aesthetic through coding and hopefully
              you will see as much in this and all other pages I create.</p>
